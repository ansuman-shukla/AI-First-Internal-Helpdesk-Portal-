## Example AI Responses

### Before (Plain Text)
```
For current stock prices and market information, I recommend:
• Check financial websites like Yahoo Finance, Google Finance, or Bloomberg
• Use your broker's app or website for real-time data
• For company stock information, check the investor relations page
```

### After (Rendered Markdown)
For current stock prices and market information, I recommend:
• Check financial websites like Yahoo Finance, Google Finance, or Bloomberg
• Use your broker's app or website for real-time data
• For company stock information, check the investor relations page

## Benefits

1. **Improved Readability**: Structured content is much easier to read
2. **Professional Appearance**: Responses look polished and well-formatted
3. **Better User Experience**: Users can quickly scan bullet points and sections
4. **Clickable Links**: External resources are easily accessible
5. **Code Formatting**: Technical instructions are clearly highlighted

## Usage

The markdown rendering is automatic:
- **AI responses**: Automatically rendered as markdown
- **User messages**: Remain as plain text for simplicity
- **Error messages**: Plain text for consistency

## Testing

To test the markdown rendering:
1. Ask the AI questions that would generate structured responses
2. Try queries like:
   - "How do I troubleshoot my wifi?"
   - "What are the latest cybersecurity trends?"
   - "Current stock price information"
3. Observe the formatted responses with proper bullet points, links, and styling

## Next Steps

The markdown rendering is now fully implemented and ready for use. Users will immediately see improved AI response formatting in both:
- The "Resolve with AI" chat modal
- AI-generated messages in ticket conversations
