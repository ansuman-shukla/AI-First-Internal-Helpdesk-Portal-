    * [x] Auto-refresh functionality tested

**Status**: ✅ **FULLY COMPLETED AND PRODUCTION-READY**

### **Key Features Implemented:**

2. **Role-based Notifications**: Automatic notification creation for relevant users based on their roles
3. **Professional Frontend**: Interactive notification bell with dropdown, badges, and actions
4. **Webhook Integration**: Automatic notifications for ticket creation, messages, and misuse detection
5. **Security**: JWT authentication and user-specific notifications
6. **Performance**: Pagination, caching, and optimistic UI updates

- 💬 **Message Received**: Notify ticket participants when new messages are sent
- ⚠️ **Misuse Detected**: Notify admins when users are flagged for potential misuse
- 🔔 **System Alerts**: General system notifications

### **Files Created/Modified:**
**Backend**: `notification.py` (schema/model), `notification_service.py`, `notifications.py` (router), enhanced webhooks, user service, ticket service

## Phase 8 (Optional): Soft Rate Limiting

* [ ] **Implement Rate Limit Logic**

  * [ ] In `app/services/rate_limit.py`, create `can_create_ticket(user_id)`:

    * [ ] Count tickets with `created_at >= now() - 24h` for that `user_id`.
    * [ ] Return `false` if count ≥ 5.
  * **Testing:**

    * [ ] Unit tests (`tests/test_rate_limit.py`) for boundary conditions (0, 4, 5, 6 tickets).

* [ ] **Integrate Rate Limit into Ticket Creation**

  * [ ] In `app/routers/tickets.py` `POST /tickets`, before HSA check, call `can_create_ticket()`.
  * [ ] If `false`, raise `HTTPException(429, "Rate limit exceeded")`.
  * **Testing:**

    * [ ] Integration test: Create 5 tickets via API, verify the 6th returns 429.

## 🎯 Implementation Plan
Let me create a detailed plan for implementing these analytics:

Phase 1: Basic Analytics Service
Create app/services/analytics_service.py
Add analytics endpoints to app/routers/admin.py
Implement basic aggregation queries
Phase 2: Advanced Analytics
Add trending topics analysis using LLM
Implement time-based analytics with date ranges
Add caching for expensive queries
Phase 3: Dashboard Integration
Create admin analytics dashboard components
Add charts and visualizations
Real-time updates via WebSocket
🔧 Technical Approach
MongoDB Aggregation Pipelines: For efficient data processing
LLM Integration: For trending topics extraction
Caching: Redis or in-memory caching for expensive queries
Pagination: For large datasets
Date Filtering: Configurable time ranges (last 7 days, 30 days, etc.)

---

## Continuous Testing & Validation

At each phase:

* [ ] **Automated Tests:** Ensure pytest suite passes 100% before advancing to next phase.
* [ ] **Manual Testing:** Manually verify key flows using HTTP clients (e.g., Postman) and WebSocket clients.
* [ ] **Linting & Formatting:** Run `black` and `flake8` before commit.
* [ ] **Code Review:** Self-review or peer-review code changes to ensure alignment with PRD.

*All tasks are aligned with the PRD and existing documentation. Break down each task further if needed to maintain clarity.*
